    Preventions from infection of Covid-19

    Know how it spreads
</h2 >
<ul>
    <li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
    <li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
    <li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</li>
    <ul>
            <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
            <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.</li>
            <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
            <li>Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.</li>
        </ul>

<h1>
    Everyone Should
</h1>
<h2>
    Wash your hands often
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
    <li>f soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
    
</ul>
</div> 
<div>
    <h2>Avoid close contact </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
        </li>
        <li>Put distance between yourself and other people outside of your home.</li>
        
        <ul>
                <li>Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.</li>
                <li>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 armsâ€™ length) from other people.</li>
                <li>Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick</li>
            </ul>
