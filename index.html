            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has
            resulted in an ongoing pandemic. The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019
            in Hubei. Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from Milan and Turin,
            Italy, on 18 December 2019. As of 29 June 2020, more than 10.1 million cases have been reported across
            188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 502,000 deaths. More than 5.14 million people have
            recovered.

            Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and
            taste. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory
            distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[16] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and
            blood clots. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may
            range from two to fourteen days.

            The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] most often via small droplets produced
            by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces
            rather than travelling through air over long distances. However, research as of June 2020 has shown that
            speech-generated droplets may remain airborne for tens of minutes. Less commonly, people may become
            infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. It is most contagious
            during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear,
            and from people who do not show symptoms. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse
            transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also
            be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and
            risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.

            Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from
            others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering
            coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of cloth face coverings such as a
            scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of
            transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use. Health officials also stated that
            medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders,
            and those who directly care for infected individuals.

            There are no vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19. Management involves the treatment
            of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures. The World Health Organization (WHO)
            declared the COVIDâ€‘19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30
            January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Local transmission of the disease has occurred in most
            countries across all six WHO regions.
